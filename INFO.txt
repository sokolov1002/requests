Database to be used: sqlite
Python version to be used: Python 3.6.*

Create 3 Python files, "main.py" "database.py" and "webrequests.py"

1. In the file "webrequests.py" create a function (method) called "get_request", which takes one parameter (the URL that needs to send the request to)
, sends a GET request, reads the response and returns only the first 10 characters of the response.	

2. In the "database.py" create three functions:

a) function "create_db" should create a new sqlite database and save the database file named "test.db" in a subfolder named "database"

b) function "create_table" creates a new table in the database; the table should be called "TestTable" and should have the following fields:
 - "id" (integer, primary key)
 - "excerpt" (varchar 255)

c) function "insert_into_db" - receives a parameter (string), inserts a new row into the table "TestTable" and saves the parameter under the field "excerpt"

3. "main.py" puts it all together.

Declare an array called "url_array" and add these 3 URLS:
 http://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-python/creating-database/
 https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2023893/python-3-get-http-page
 http://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-python/create-tables/

Create a fuinction called "run"

Inside the function do the following:
 - using the already created function (function "create_db" from "database.py"), create the database
 - create the table "TestTable" using the function "create_table" from "database.py"
 
In a loop, for each of the URLs in the "url_array" array do the following:

 - send GET request to the URL using the "get_request" function from "webrequests.py" and return the first 10 characters of the response
 - inserts a new row into the table "TestTable" and save the first 10 characters of the response under the field "excerpt"
 - continue with the next URL untill all 3 URLs are processed


Call the funciton "run" from code, so that when the "main.py" is run, the function runs

Please make sure that you catch errors too and print them to screen (to the console) - use try/catch
